## Overview
This project was part of my design studio class, CPEN 291. It consists of a web-based application controlling a robotic arm to play mini-golf in a real-world setting, offering an immersive IoT gaming experience.

## Features

### Web Application Control
- Utilizes a Flask-based web server for user interaction.
- Allows control over the robotic arm to hit balls into holes on a mini-golf course.

### Hardware Integration
- Detailed construction of the golf course and robotic arm using 3D printed parts, cardboard, and electronics for a real-life game setup.

### Software Backend
- Backend logic implemented on a Linux VM using Flask.
- Manages game logic, score tracking, and communication between the Raspberry Pi Pico and the web application.

### Frontend Design
- Interactive web design with HTML/CSS/JS.
- Features game controls, live score updates, and game state management through AJAX get() and post() calls for a dynamic user experience.
